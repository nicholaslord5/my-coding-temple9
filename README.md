# my-coding-temple9
# This is my repository for the mini-project; it is a to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and track their tasks. 
# Users have the options to add tasks to and delete tasks from the list. 
# Tasks are "incomplete" by default, and users have the ability to mark tasks as complete as they go. They also have the ability to view their entire task list of complete and incomplete tasks to see what has been accomplished and what still needs to be done.
